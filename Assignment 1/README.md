# AI HW 1

## Todo List
- part 0 - dhvani
	- set up environment
	- generate 50 gridworlds of size 101x101 with dfs
	- store them
- part 1 - dhvani
	- read textbook
	- part a - do the example search problem and explain
	- part b
		- prove that agent reaches target in finite time or finds blocks
		- prove that number of moves is bounded by number of unblocked cells squared
- part 1.5
  - implement binary heap - done
- part 2 - jasmin 
	- implement repeated forward a* algorithm
	- jasmin already started this
  - use $c \times f(s) - g(s)$ to break ties
  - need to test
- part 3 - jasmin
	- implement repeated backward a* algorithm
  - compare runtimes
  - need to test
- part 4 - rajeev
	- Prove that Manhattan distances are consistent
	- prove that adaptive a* works
- part 5 - rajeev
	- implement adaptive a*
 	- compare runtimes
	- need to test
- part 6 - rajeev
	- read up on how to perform a statistical hypothesis test
	- describe how you would do it on the class of a* algorithms
- report - everyone
	- write in LaTeX
	- need to submit .tex file (as part of zip) and .pdf file as final output
	- need to start this first so that everyone has a place to put their results
